# Automated fact checking tools

List of tools that help automating steps from the fact-checking process. This mapping began in a final work project for my Journalism degree in 2020. The idea is to keep updating it as new tools are created. This is a work in progress, so feel free to suggest adding new tools or updating information.

## How to suggest a change

You can open a new issue or submit a pull request. The current structure to add a new tool is the following:
* [name of the tool]; [target audience]; [platform]; [available languages]; [fact-checking phase it helps automating (e.g., monitoring claims, spotting claims, fact-checking, sharing a checked fact); [source]; [date added]
